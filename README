File Dissect is a cross-platform framework and UI for analyzing
various file formats. It is based on wxWidgets since it provides a
native feel regardless of base OS. It has been designed with a tiered
plug-in architecture to facilitate the quick and easy addition of new
dissectors or sub-dissectors.

It has been contructed using a custom wxHexView widget and
automatically associates items within a wxTreeView with positions
within the wxHexView. As such, it is possible to select all associated
bytes in the wxHexView by right clicking a node in the wxTreeView.

It was originally developed during jduck's tenure at VeriSign's
iDefense Labs from 2007 til 2009. It was subsequently released under
a BSD License, the license which it holds today.
